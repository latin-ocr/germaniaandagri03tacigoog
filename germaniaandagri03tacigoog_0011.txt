which it is hoped may serve to enldbit the author in his relation
to the history, and especially to the literature, of his age.

4. The department in which less remained to be done than
any other, for the elucidation of Tacitus, was that of Geography.

’ History, and Archaeology. The copious notes of Gordon and

Murphy left little to be desired in tlds line; and these notes are
not only accessible to American scholare in their original forms,
but hauc been incorporated, more or less, into all the college
editions. lf any peculiar merit attaches to this edition, in this
department, it will be found in the frequent references to such
classic authors as furnish collateral information, aud in the
illustration of the private life of the Romans, by the help of such
recent works as Becher’s Gallus. The editor bas also been

· t. Many of the ablest commentarios on the Germania and
Agricola have appeared within a comparatively recent period,
some of them remarkable examples of critical acumen and
exegetical tact, and ,athera models of school aad college
editions. It has been the endeavor of tbe editor to bring down
the literature pertaining to Tacitus to the present time, and tu

labora of such recent German editors as Grimm, Giinther,
Gruber, Kiessling, Dronke, Roth, Ruperti, and Walther.

The textis, in the main, that of Walther, though the other
editors just named have been consulted; and in such minor

the reading which seemed best to accord with the usage and
genius of Tacitus, especially when sanctioned by a decided pre-
ponderance of critical suffrage. Other readings have been
referred to in the Notes, sofar as they are of any considerable
importunae, or supported by respectable authority. Partly for
convenience, but chiefly aa a matter of teste, Ι have ventured
to follow the German editions in dispensing entirely with diacri

tical marks, and in some peculiarities of less importance, which
ifnot viewed with favor, it is hopod, will not be judged witb
