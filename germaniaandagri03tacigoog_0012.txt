severity. The punctuation is the result of a diligent coinpnrison
of the best editions, together witha cureful study of the con
nexion ol language and of thought.

The German editions above mentioned, together with severa·
Ptench, English, and American works, have not only been con· ,
stantly before me, but have been used with great freedom, arrd
credit awarded to them accordingly. Some may think their
names should have appeared less frequently; others that they
should have received credit to a still greater extent. Suffice it
to say, Ι have never intended to quote the language, or borrow
the thoughts of an author, without giving his name; and in mat·
ters of fact or opinion, Ι have cited authorities not only when l
have been indebted to them for the suggestion, but whenever, in
a case of coincidence of views‚ Ι thought the authorities would
be of any interest to the student.

Ι have not considered it needlul, with German scrupulosa, to
distinguish between my own references and those of others. lt
may safely be taken for granted, that the major, perhaps the bet·
ter, part of them have been derived from foreign sources. Bur
no references have been admitted on trust. They haveleen care
Ι fully verified, and it is hoped that numerous as thcy are, they
will be found pertinent and useful, whether illustrative of things,
or of mere verbal usage. Some, who use th„ oook, will doubtless
find occasion to follow them out either in whole or in part; anu
those who do not, will gain ageneral impressiones totbe sources
from'which collateral information may be obtained, that will be
of no small value.

The frequent references to the Notes of Professor Kingsley,
will show the estimation in which Ι hold thern. Perhaps I hova
⁵ used them too freely. My only apology is, that sofar as they
gc, they are just what is wanted; and if Ι had avoided using ’
'them toa considerable extent, I must have substituted something
less perfectos my own. Harl they been more copious, and
extended more to verbal and grammatical illustratione, these
Notes never would have appeared.

The editoris convinced, froin his experiencc as a teacher‚
