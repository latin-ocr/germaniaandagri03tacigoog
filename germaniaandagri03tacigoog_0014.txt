ιο have been executed, and en whose ripe scholarship and
familiarity with the German language and literature, I chiefly
relied forits successful accomplishment.

I should not do justice to my feelings, were 1 to omit the
expression ol my obligations to the printer and publisbers sor
the unwearied patience with which they have labored to perfect
the work, under all the disadvantages attending the superin-
tendance ol the prees, at such a distance. Il there should still
be sound in it inaccuracies and blemisbes, it will not be because
they hare spared any pains to make it a correct and beautiful
book.

lt is with unleigned diffidenca that I submit to the public this
first attempt at literary labor. Ι am fully senslble ol its
many imperfectione, at the same time l am consciens oi an ability
to make it better at some future day, should it meet the savor-
able regard of the classical teachers of our land, to whom it is
dedicated as an humble contribuu'on to that cause in which
they are now laboring, with such unprecedented aeal. Should
it contributa in any measure to a better understanding, or a
higher appreciation by our youthful countrymen ol a classic
author, from whom, beyond almost any other, Ι have drawn in
struction and delight, l shall not bave labored in vain.
