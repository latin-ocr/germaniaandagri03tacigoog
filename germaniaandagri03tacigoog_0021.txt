Tacitus was educated scr the bar, and continued te pleat
causes, occasionelly at least, and with not a little success,
even alter he had entered upon the great business os his lile,
as a writer os history. We find references to his first, and
perhaps his last appearance, as an advocate, in the Letters of
Pliny, which are highly complimentary. The first was, when
Pliny was nineteen, and Tacitus a little older (how much we
are not insermed), when Tacitus distinguished himself, so es
to awalren the emulation and the envy, though notin a bad
sense, cf Pliny. The last was some twenty years later, when
Tacitus and Pliny, the tried friends ol a whole life, the brightest
ornaments ol'literaturs and of the forum, were associated by

the choice ol the Senate, and pleaded together at the bar cf ⁷

the Senate, and in the presence of the Emperor Trajan,.lor
the execution ol justice upon Marius Priscus, who was
accused of mal-adnunistration in the proconsulship ol Africa.
Pliny says, that Tacitus spoke with 'singular grevity and
eloquence, and the Senate passed a 'unanimous vote ol appro-
bation and thaulrs to both the orators, for the ability and suc·
cess with which they had managed the prosecution (Plin.
Epis. ii. ll).

We have also the comments cl Pliny on a panegyrioal
oration, which Tacitus pronounced, when consul, upon his

predecessor in the consular office,'Verginius Rufus, perhaps ’ ⁴

the most remarkable man of his age, distinguished alilre as
a hero, a statesmau, aud a scholar, and yet so ¹modest or so
wisc that he repeatedly refused the offer ol the imperial ‘purple
“Pomone'' says Pliny, “always laithlul telleiginius, reserved
lor herlast lavor, such an orator to pronounce a eulogium on
such virtues, It was enough to crowu the glery of a well
spem lile” (Plin.v Epis. ii. 1).
