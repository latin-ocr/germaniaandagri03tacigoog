Simple narrative no longer suited the pampered teste of the
readers or the writers os history. lt must be highly sessoned
with sentimentalism and moralizing, with romanoe and poetry.
Tacitus, certainly, did not escape the iniection. ln the lan·
gange of Macaulay, “He carries his love of effect sar beyond
the limite of moderatim, He tells atine story finely, but ho

point out not a few exemplos os rhetorical pomp, and poetical
coloring, and even needless multiplicatiori ol words, where
¹plainness and precision would have been much better, and
which may well surprise us in a writer of so much conciseness.

Lord Monboddo, in a very able, though somewhat extravagent

critique 'on Tacitus, has selected numerous instancos of what
he calls the ornamented dry style, many oi which are so concise,

’ so rough, and so broken, that he says, they do not deservo the

name os composition, but seem rather like the raw materials of
history, tlren like history itself (Orig. and Prog. of Lang, vol
iii. chap. 12). .

Still, few readers can sail to pronounce Tacitus as Maesulay
affirma, and even Lord Monboddo'admits him to be, the greatest
