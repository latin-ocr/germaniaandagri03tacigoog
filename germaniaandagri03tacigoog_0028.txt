In a faithful pertraiture of the private and public life of the

degenerata Romans, there was much to eall for the handof a
master in sotice. And we find in tbe glowing sketches of our
author,¹ all the vigor and pointel a Juvenal, without bis vulgarity
and obscenity; all'the borning indignation which the Latin is
so peculiarly capable of expressing, with all the vigor end
stateliness by which the same language ie equally characterized.
Tacitus has been sometimes represented as a very Diogenes,
se! carping and sarcasm-a very Aristophanes, to blacken
character with ridicule and reproach. But he is as far removed
from the cynic or tho buffoon, as from the panegyrist or the
liaberet. He is'not the indiscriminate admirer that Plutarch
was. Nor is he suchauniversal hater as Sallust lt is the
fault of tbe umes that be is obliged to deal so much in censure.
lt there ever were perfect monsters on earth, such were several
os the Roman Emperors. Yet Tacitus describes few, if any,
of them without some os the traits of humanity. Hc gives -us
io his history neither demens nor gods, but veritable men and
women. ln this respect. as also in his descriptione cf battles.
