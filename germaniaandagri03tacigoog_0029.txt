Tacitus is decidedly superior to Livy. The characters ol Livy

areadr'stinguishable only as classes-tho good all very good.
the badtvery‘bad,.the indifferent very indifferent. You dis·
cover no importent difference between a Fabius and a Marcellus,
further than it lies on the sace ol their actions. In Tacitus,
tho characters are all individuale. Each stands out distinctly
from the surroundiug multitude, and not only performs his
own proper actions, but is governed by his own peculiar '
motives. tLivy places before us the statues of heroes and

,gods; Tacitus conducta us through the crowd of living men. ·

In an attempt to sketch the most striking leatures os Tacitus,
as a writer, no critic can omitto mention his sago and pithy
maxims. Apothegms abound on every page—sagacious, truth-
lul, and profound in sentiment, in style concise, antithetic and
sententious. Doubtless he is excessively lond of pointed
antidtesi's. Perhaps he is too much given to moralizing and
reflection. Itwas,as wie have said, the inultos his age. But·
no ,one,.who is familiar with Seneca, will severely censuree
Tacitus. He will only wonder that he should have risen so
lar above the laults of his contemporaries. Indead, Tacitus

, iaterweaves his reflections with so much propriety, and clothes

his apothegms with so much dignity-lre is so manifestly‘coaa
¹ potem to instruct the world by maxims, whether in civil, social,
or-individual life, that we are lar from wishing he had indulged
in it less. His reflections do not interrnpt the thread of his
uanadve. They grow naturally out ol his incidente. They
break forth spontaneously from the lips of his men. ·His
history is indeed philosophy teaclring by examples3 and his
pithy sayings are truly lessons ol wisdom‚ embodied in the
lorm most likely to strilte the attention, and impress the

momory. We should love to sae a collection oi apothegms .

stom the pen of Tacitus. lt would make ap admirable book
