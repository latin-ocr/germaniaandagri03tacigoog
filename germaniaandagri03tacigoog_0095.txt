The author does indeed, in the passage just cited, seem ιο appre
elate with almost prophetie aceuracy, these dangers ιο the Roman
Empire, which were so fearfully illustrated in its subsequent fall be·
naath the power cf the German Tribes5 and he attera, as what truc
Roman would not in such forebodings, the warnings and the prays
ers of a patrict sege. But lie does this only in episodcs‚ which are
so manifestly incidental, and yet arise so naturally out oi the narra· ι
tive or description, that it is trulysurprising it should ever have oc·
curred ιο any render, to seek in them the key to the whole treatisa

The entire warp and woof of the work is obviously histori-
σοι and geographieal. The satira, the political maxims, the moral
sentimenta, and all the rest, are merely incidental, interwoven for
thc sake oi instruction and embellishment, inwrought because a mind
sc thoughtiul and sc aeute as that ci Tacitus, could not leave them
out. Tacitus had long been cellecting the materiale sor his Roman
Historias In so doing, his attention was necessarily drawn often
and with special interest to a people, who, sor two centuries and
more, had been the most formidable enemy os the Roman State. Iu

some preliminary account of their origin, manners, and institutione,
as he does in introducing the Jews in the Fiith Book oi his Historias,

ii he should, with this view, collect a mass oi materials, which he
could not incorporate entire into a work of such composa, and which
any slight occasion might induce him tc publish in a separate form, ¹
perhaps as a sort oi forerunnar to his Histories* Such an occasion
now was iumished in the campaigns and victories of Trajan, who,
at the time oi his elevation ιο the imperial power, was at the head
ci the Roman armies in Germany, where he also remainedfor a year
or more after his accession ιο the throne, till he had received the sub·
mission ol the hostile tribes and wiped away the disgraca which the
Germana, beyond any other nation oi that age, had brought upon
the Roman mma Such a people, at such a time, could not lail to be
an objectet deep interest at Roma This was the time when Taci-
tus published his work on Germany; and such are believed ιο hara

been the motivas and the circumstances, which led to the under· '

'l'aeltus le itself only such a collection os materiale, not published by the author,
and nevar intended sor publication in that torm. But it is quite sco metlrodical, tor
