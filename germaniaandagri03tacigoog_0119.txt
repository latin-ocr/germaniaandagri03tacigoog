XV. Noa mattam The common reading (muitum without

. the negative) is a mere conjecture, aud that suggested by a misap

prehension oi the meaning of T. Noa maltam is to be taken eom·
paratively. Thaugh in time of peace they hunt often, yet they
spsnd aa arach more tina ia eatirap, drinking, aad alerpiag, that the
former is comparativcly small. Thus understood t'nis passage oi
T. is not inconsistent with the¹ declaratione af caesar, B. G. 6, 21:
Vita Germanorum omnis in venationibus atque in studiis rei miii-
taris consistit Caesar leaves out oi account their periods oi inae
tion, and speaks onl‘y oi their active employments, which wore war
and the chase It was the special object of Tacitus, on the contrary,.
to give prominence to that striking feature of the German character
which Caesar overlooks; and thcrein, as Wr. well observes, the
later historiari shows his more exact acquaintance with the Germana.
Noa aarum, as opposed to pta«, is nearly equivalent to micae

similar construction in antithetic clauses; T. seems* rather to
avoid it In all such cases however, astho examples just cited
show, per with the acc. is not prccisciy equivalent to the abi. The
abl. is moro active and implies means, agency; the acc with par
is mors passive and denotas manner or occasion.
