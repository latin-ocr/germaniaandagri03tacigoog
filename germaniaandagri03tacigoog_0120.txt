he was readings description of the manner of life among our Arna
rican Indians It may ba remarked here, once for all, that this rs· ι
semblence may be traced in very many particulam, e. g. in their
personal independencc, in the military chieftaiasand their followers,
in their extreme fondness for the hardships aad dangcrs of war, in
their strange inactivity, gluttony and drunkenness in peace, in their
deliberativa assemblies and tha power of eloqucnee to sway their
counsels, in their half elective, half hereditary form of government,
in the spirituality of their conceptione ol God, and some other f -
tures of their religien (Robertson has drawn out this comparison in
his history of Oharles V). All tribes in a rude and savage state

must have many similar usages and traits of character. And this κ

’ resemblance between the well-known habits of our wandering
savages and those which T. ascribes to the rude tribes of Germany‚
may impress us with confidence in the trulhiulncss df his narrative.
