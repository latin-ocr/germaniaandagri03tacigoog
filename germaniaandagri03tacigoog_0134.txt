But cn the whole, these speculatione of German antiquarians are

not only less interesting to scholam in other countries, bnt are
so unsatisfactory and contradictory among themselves, that, for
the most part, we shall pass thern over with very little atten-
tion. There is manifestly an intrinsic difficultyin defining the
ever changing limita of uncivilined and unsettled tribes. Hence
the irreconcilable contradicticns between ardeat orsttorits'as, as
well aa modern critiqnes, on this subject Tacitus, and the
Roman writers generally, betray their want of definite know-
ledge of Germany by the frequency' with which they specify tho
names of mountains and 'rivers The following geographical out

the Chatti are the Cherusci, 36, whose neighbors are the Fosi. The
Cherusci perhaps, according to Tacitus, do not reach to the ocean;

Tacitus represents the western half of Cermeny. Tho eastern is of
