The following paragraph from Prichard's Researcheaembodies
some ol the more general conclusione of etbaoproptcrs, especially ol
Zeuss, on whom Prichard, in common with Orelli and many other
scholare, places great reliance. “Along the coast ot' the German
Ocean and across the isthmus os the Cimbric peninsula to the shore
of the Baltic, were spread the tribes of the Chauci and Frisii, the
Anglii, Saxones and the Teutones or tutes, who spoka the Bora
Gemma languages, and formed one os the four divisioirs ot' the
German raca, corresponding as it seems with the Iapaeooaea ol
Tacitus and Pliny. 1n the higher and more central parts, the
second grean division of the rece, that os the Hermam, was spread,
the tribes of which spoke Upper or triptolemon dialecta Bagin-
ing in the West with the country oi the Sigambn' on' the Rhine, and
from that 01⁴ the Cherusci and Angrivarii near the Weser and the
Hertz, this division comprehended, besidesflthose tribes, the Chatti,
the Langobardi, the Hermunduri, the Marcomanni and Quadi, tha
Lugii, and beyond the Vistula the Bastarnae, in the neighborhood
of the Carpathian hille -Το the eastward and northward os the last
mentioned, near the lower course of the Vistula and thence at least
astar aa the Pregcl, were the primitive abodes of the Goths and
their cognate tribes, who are perhaps the Ietaeooaea.” The fourth
division ol Prichard embraced the Scandinavians, who spolre a lan·
gnage kindred to the Germana and were usually classed with them.
These who would examine this subject more thoronghly, will oon·

who have written expressly on the geography or the ethnography
aiGermany.
