Trrn Biograplry of Agricola was written early in the reign ol Tnajan ,

(which commeneed Α U. C. sol. A. D. 98), eonseqnently about tlte
same time with the Germania, though perhaps somewhat later (of.
notes on Germania). This date is established by inference from tha
author's own language in the ad and the aeth sections (see notes).
In the former, he speaks ol the dawn oia better day, which opened
indeed with the reign of Nerva, but which is now brightening oon-
stantLy under the auspices of Trajan. The use of the past tenso
(miscuerit) here in respect to Nerva, and ol the present (capeat) in
respect to Trajan, is quito conclusive evidence, that at the time ol
writing, the reign of Nerva was past, and that of Trajan had
already begun. ⁸

The other passage is, if possible, still moro clearly demonstrative
ol the same d'a'te. Here in drawing the same eontrast between past
tyranny and present heedom, the author, withoutmentioning Nerva,
records the desire and hope, which his father-in-law expressed in his
· hearing, that he might live to see Trajan cleveted to the imperial
throne—langnage very proper and courtly, if Trajan were already
Emperor, but a very awkwaru compliment to Nerva, if, as many
critias suppose, he were still the reigning prince.

It is objected to this date, thatit Nerva were not still living, Taci-
tus could not have failed to attach to his name (in t 3.) the epithet
Dima with which deceased Emperors were usually honored. And
from the omission ot this epithet in connection with the name ol
Nerea, together with theterms ol honor in which Trajan is men-
tioned, it is inferred that the piece was written in that brief period
ol three months, ¹which intervened between the adoption ol Trajan
by Nerva, and Nerwa's death (see Brotier and many others). But
