the application of the epithet iu question, was not a matter or
necessity or of universal practice. Its omission in this ease might
have been occidental, or might have proceedod srom unknown rea-

sons And the bare absence of a single word surely cannot bc
cntitled to much woight, in compar-ison with the obvious and
μ almost necessary impert of the passages just cited.

The primary object of the work is sufficiently obvious. It aaa
to honor thememory cf the writer'e excellent father-inlaav, Agricola
(ott 3: honori Agricolae, mei soceri, destinatus). So far from
apologizing for waiting the life of sc near a friend, he feels assured
that his motives will be appreciated and his design approved, how-
ever imperfect may be its executicn; and hedeems an apology neces
sary for having so long delayed the perfer-mance of that filial duty.
After an introduction of singular beauty ond appropriateness (cf.
notes), he sketches a brief outline of the parente-ge, education ond
early life of Agricola, but drawa out more at length the history of his
consulship and command in Britain, of which the following sum-
mary, from Hume’s History of England, may not be unprofitable to
the student in anticipation: “ Agricola was the general, who finally
established the dominion of the Romans in this island. He governed
it in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. IIe carried his
victorious arms northward; defeated the Britons in every succentor,
pieroed into the foresta and the mountains of Caledonia, reduced
every stateto subjection in the southern parts of the island, and
chased before him all the meu of fiercer and more intractable spirits,
who doemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude
under the victora He defeated them in a decisivo aetion which
they fought under Galgacus; and having fixed a chain of garrisons
between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he cut off the ruder and more
barren parts of the island and ceonred the Romah province from
the incursione of the more burbarous inhabitante. During these
military enterprises, he neglected not the arts of peace. He intro-
duced laws and civility among the Britons3 taught them to desire
and raiae allthe convenienoes of lile3 reconcilari them to the Ro
man language and manners; instructed them in letters and scienoe;
and employed every expedient to render those chains which
he had forged both easy aud agreeable to them.” (His of Eng.
vol. 1.)
