Tacitus pomessed poculiar advantages for being the historica 01 the
early Britona His father-inlawwas the first 10 subject the whole

island to the away of Rome. He traversed the country from south
to north at the head 01 his armies, explored it with his own eyes, ¹
· and reported what he saw 10 our author with his own lips. He
saw the Britans too, in their native noblcncss, in their primitive love
01 liberty and virtue ;¹ before they had become the slaves of Roman
arms, the dupes 01 Roman arts, or the victims of Roman vices A few
paragraphs in the concise and nervous style 01 Tacitus, hare mado us
quite acquaintcd with the Britons, as Agricola found them; and on
the whole, we baveno reason to be ashamed 01 the primaevalinhab·
itanta of the land 01 our ancestry. They knew their rights, they
prizcd them, they fought for them bravelyand died for them nobly.
More harmony among themselves might have delaycd, but could

and 11 we would atthis day investigate the elementa 01 English law,
we bave it on the authority 01 Sir William Blackstone, that we
must trace them back 10 their founders in thc customs of the Britons
and Germans, as recorded by Caesar and Tacitus.
