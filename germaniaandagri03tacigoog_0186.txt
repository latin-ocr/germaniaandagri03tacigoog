Namque-cogebantur. 'she best version we can give of this ob·
saure passage is as follows: For tlscy uera corripelled ιο mcckcry lo
sit by rae cloaccl prunarias asad to tay cora nccdleaaly (beyond what
was necessary, cf. note on ultro, G. 28, when they had enough oi
their own) aad to'aell ιι at c fiaed price (prescribed by the pur·
chasers). It has been made a question, whether the granaries ol the
Britons, or those of the Romans are here meant Ded, Dr. and R.
advocate the tormer opinion; Waloh, Wu, Or, aud Rit. the latter
According ιο the tormer view, the Britons were often obliged to
buy corn os the Romans, because they were forbidden to use their
own, to supply themselves and their families3 according ιο the lat

contributione ιο aquarter so <lislam from their own maneries, that

enough be rendered morcouer or aaa thus giving emphasis to
caere.

’ Dacorto'a itinerum Bya reads, explained by avia, as longinquitas ⁸

contributione to such distant and inconvenient points, was to com·
pel them to buy of the Romans, or ιο pay almost any sum os money
to avoid campliance The reader of Oia will remember in illustra·
tion os this whole passage, the various arte to which Verres is said
to have had recourse to enrich himselt, at the expense oi the people
of his province (Cic in Ver. 3, 72, and ιι), such as refusing to accept
the contributione they brought, obliging them to buy ol him at his
own price, requiring them to camy supplies to points most distant
and difficolt of access, at vecturae difficaltate ad quam uellent acati·
amonem peruenirent.
