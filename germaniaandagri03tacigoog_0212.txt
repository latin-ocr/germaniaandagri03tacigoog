Harkncss's Caesar.

This edition of Caesar's Commentaries, intended to follow the Latin
Reader, aims to introduce the student to an appreciative study of Latin
authors. The text is the result of a careful collation of the several edi
tione most approved by European scholare. The 'notes are intended to
gulde the faithful efforts of the learner, and to furnish him such collateral
information as will enable him to understand the stirring events recorded
in the CommentarieS‚ and such special aid as will enable him to surmount
real difficulties oi construction and idiom. They will thus, it is hoped,
render an acceptable service both to the instructor and the learner, by
lightening the hurden oi'the one, and by promoting the prognaes of the
other. The dictionary has boen prepared with special reference to the
arants of the student.

'she Life cf (laesar, tho Map of Gaul, and the diagrams and illustra-
tione which accompony tho notes, will greatly add tc the value of tho
work.
